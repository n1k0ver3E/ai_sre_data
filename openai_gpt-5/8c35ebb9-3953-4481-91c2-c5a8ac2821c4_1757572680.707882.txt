[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are an expert DevOps engineer assigned to localize faults in a deployed service.\n\nService Details:\nService Name: Social Network\nNamespace: test-social-network\nDescription: A social network with unidirectional follow relationships, implemented with loosely-coupled microservices, communicating with each other via Thrift RPCs.\nSupported Operations:\n  - Create text post (optional media: image, video, shortened URL, user tag)\n  - Read post\n  - Read entire user timeline\n  - Receive recommendations on which users to follow\n  - Search database for user or post\n  - Register/Login using user credentials\n  - Follow/Unfollow user\n\nYou are requested to identify the service(s) where the root cause of the fault lies.\nYou will begin by analyzing the service\'s state and telemetry, and then submit one of two possible solutions:\n1. list[str]: list of faulty components (i.e., service names)\n2. list[]: an empty list if no faults were detected\n\nYou are provided with a direct API to a secure terminal to the service where you can run commands:\n\nexec_shell\nExecute any shell command in a predefined debugging environment.\n        Note: this is NOT A STATEFUL OR INTERACTIVE shell session. So you cannot\n        execute commands like "kubectl edit".\n\n        Args:\n            command (str): The command to execute.\n\n        Returns:\n            str: The output of the command.\n\nFinally, you will submit your solution for this task using the following API:\n\nsubmit\nSubmit the detected faulty components to the orchestrator for evaluation.\n\n        Args:\n            faulty_components (list[str]): List of faulty components (i.e., service names).\n\n        Returns:\n            SubmissionStatus: The status of the submission.\n\nIMPORTANT:\n1. The submit() call must strictly follow its defined parameter signature for this task.\n2. Provide the call in a markdown code block.\n\nAt each turn respond with:\nAction: <your action>\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '            You will respond with one of the above APIs as your next

files in current directory, your response must be exactly:\n\n            ```\nexec_shell("ls -l")\n```\n\n            If there are faulty components to submit:\n\n

[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are an expert DevOps engineer assigned to localize faults in a deployed service.\n\nService Details:\nService Name: Social Network\nNamespace: test-social-network\nDescription: A social network with unidirectional follow relationships, implemented with loosely-coupled microservices, communicating with each other via Thrift RPCs.\nSupported Operations:\n  - Create text post (optional media: image, video, shortened URL, user tag)\n  - Read post\n  - Read entire user timeline\n  - Receive recommendations on which users to follow\n  - Search database for user or post\n  - Register/Login using user credentials\n  - Follow/Unfollow user\n\nYou are requested to identify the service(s) where the root cause of the fault lies.\nYou will begin by analyzing the service\'s state and telemetry, and then submit one of two possible solutions:\n1. list[str]: list of faulty components (i.e., service names)\n2. list[]: an empty list if no faults were detected\n\nYou are provided with a direct API to a secure terminal to the service where you can run commands:\n\nexec_shell\nExecute any shell command in a predefined debugging environment.\n        Note: this is NOT A STATEFUL OR INTERACTIVE shell session. So you cannot\n        execute commands like "kubectl edit".\n\n        Args:\n            command (str): The command to execute.\n\n        Returns:\n            str: The output of the command.\n\nFinally, you will submit your solution for this task using the following API:\n\nsubmit\nSubmit the detected faulty components to the orchestrator for evaluation.\n\n        Args:\n            faulty_components (list[str]): List of faulty components (i.e., service names).\n\n        Returns:\n            SubmissionStatus: The status of the submission.\n\nIMPORTANT:\n1. The submit() call must strictly follow its defined parameter signature for this task.\n2. Provide the call in a markdown code block.\n\nAt each turn respond with:\nAction: <your action>\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '            You will respond with one of the above APIs as your next action.\n            Please respond in the following format in a markdown code block:\n            ```\n<API_NAME>(<API_PARAM1>, <API_PARAM2> ...)\n```\n\n            For instance, if you want to list files in current directory, your response must be exactly:\n\n            ```\nexec_shell("ls -l")\n```\n\n            If there are faulty components to submit:\n\n

[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are an expert DevOps engineer assigned to localize faults in a deployed service.\n\nService Details:\nService Name: Social Network\nNamespace: test-social-network\nDescription: A social network with unidirectional follow relationships, implemented with loosely-coupled microservices, communicating with each other via Thrift RPCs.\nSupported Operations:\n  - Create text post (optional media: image, video, shortened URL, user tag)\n  - Read post\n  - Read entire user timeline\n  - Receive recommendations on which users to follow\n  - Search database for user or post\n  - Register/Login using user credentials\n  - Follow/Unfollow user\n\nYou are requested to identify the service(s) where the root cause of the fault lies.\nYou will begin by analyzing the service\'s state and telemetry, and then submit one of two possible solutions:\n1. list[str]: list of faulty components (i.e., service names)\n2. list[]: an empty list if no faults were detected\n\nYou are provided with a direct API to a secure terminal to the service where you can run commands:\n\nexec_shell\nExecute any shell command in a predefined debugging environment.\n        Note: this is NOT A STATEFUL OR INTERACTIVE shell session. So you cannot\n        execute commands like "kubectl edit".\n\n        Args:\n            command (str): The command to execute.\n\n        Returns:\n            str: The output of the command.\n\nFinally, you will submit your solution for this task using the following API:\n\nsubmit\nSubmit the detected faulty components to the orchestrator for evaluation.\n\n        Args:\n            faulty_components (list[str]): List of faulty components (i.e., service names).\n\n        Returns:\n            SubmissionStatus: The status of the submission.\n\nIMPORTANT:\n1. The submit() call must strictly follow its defined parameter signature for this task.\n2. Provide the call in a markdown code block.\n\nAt each turn respond with:\nAction: <your action>\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '            You will respond with one of the above APIs as your next

files in current directory, your response must be exactly:\n\n            ```\nexec_shell("ls -l")\n```\n\n            If there are faulty components to submit:\n\n

So you cannot\n        execute commands like "kubectl edit".\n\n        Args:\n            command (str): The command to execute.\n\n        Returns:\n            str: The output of the command.\n\nFinally, you will submit your solution for this task using the following API:\n\nsubmit\nSubmit the detected faulty components to the orchestrator for evaluation.\n\n        Args:\n            faulty_components (list[str]): List of faulty components (i.e., service names).\n\n        Returns:\n            SubmissionStatus: The status of the submission.\n\nIMPORTANT:\n1. The submit() call must strictly follow its defined parameter signature for this task.\n2.

files in current directory, your response must be exactly:\n\n            ```\nexec_shell("ls -l")\n```\n\n            If there are faulty components to submit:\n\n
