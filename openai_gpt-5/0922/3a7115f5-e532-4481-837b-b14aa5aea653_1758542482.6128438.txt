[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are an expert DevOps engineer assigned to detect anomalies in a deployed service.\n\nService Details:\nService Name: Social Network\nNamespace: test-social-network\nDescription: A social network with unidirectional follow relationships, implemented with loosely-coupled microservices, communicating with each other via Thrift RPCs.\nSupported Operations:\n  - Create text post (optional media: image, video, shortened URL, user tag)\n  - Read post\n  - Read entire user timeline\n  - Receive recommendations on which users to follow\n  - Search database for user or post\n  - Register/Login using user credentials\n  - Follow/Unfollow user\n\nYou will begin by analyzing the service\'s state and telemetry, and then submit your solution:\n1. str: "Yes" or "No" to indicate whether there are anomalies detected\n\nYou are provided with a direct API to a secure terminal to the service where you can run commands:\n\nexec_shell\nExecute any shell command in a predefined debugging environment.\n        Note: this is NOT A STATEFUL OR INTERACTIVE shell session. So you cannot\n        execute commands like "kubectl edit".\n\n        Args:\n            command (str): The command to execute.\n\n        Returns:\n            str: The output of the command.\n\nFinally, you will submit your solution for this task using the following API:\n\nsubmit\nSubmit if anomalies are detected to the orchestrator for evaluation.\n\n        Args:\n            has_anomaly (str): "Yes" if anomalies are detected, "No" otherwise.\n\n        Returns:\n            SubmissionStatus: The status of the submission.\n\nIMPORTANT:\n1. The submit() call must strictly follow its defined parameter signature for this task.\n2.

[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are an expert DevOps engineer assigned to detect anomalies in a deployed service.\n\nService Details:\nService Name: Social Network\nNamespace: test-social-network\nDescription: A social network with unidirectional follow relationships, implemented with loosely-coupled microservices, communicating with each other via Thrift RPCs.\nSupported Operations:\n  - Create text post (optional media: image, video, shortened URL, user tag)\n  - Read post\n  - Read entire user timeline\n  - Receive recommendations on which users to follow\n  - Search database for user or post\n  - Register/Login using user credentials\n  - Follow/Unfollow user\n\nYou will begin by analyzing the service\'s state and telemetry, and then submit your solution:\n1. str: "Yes" or "No" to indicate whether there are anomalies detected\n\nYou are provided with a direct API to a secure terminal to the service where you can run commands:\n\nexec_shell\nExecute any shell command in a predefined debugging environment.\n        Note: this is NOT A STATEFUL OR INTERACTIVE shell session. So you cannot\n        execute commands like "kubectl edit".\n\n        Args:\n            command (str): The command to execute.\n\n        Returns:\n            str: The output of the command.\n\nFinally, you will submit your solution for this task using the following API:\n\nsubmit\nSubmit if anomalies are detected to the orchestrator for evaluation.\n\n        Args:\n            has_anomaly (str): "Yes" if anomalies are detected, "No" otherwise.\n\n        Returns:\n            SubmissionStatus: The status of the submission.\n\nIMPORTANT:\n1. The submit() call must strictly follow its defined parameter signature for this task.\n2. Provide the call in a markdown code block.\n\nAt each turn respond with:\nAction: <your action>\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '            You will respond with one of the above APIs as your next

[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are an expert DevOps engineer assigned to detect anomalies in a deployed service.\n\nService Details:\nService Name: Social Network\nNamespace: test-social-network\nDescription: A social network with unidirectional follow relationships, implemented with loosely-coupled microservices, communicating with each other via Thrift RPCs.\nSupported Operations:\n  - Create text post (optional media: image, video, shortened URL, user tag)\n  - Read post\n  - Read entire user timeline\n  - Receive recommendations on which users to follow\n  - Search database for user or post\n  - Register/Login using user credentials\n  - Follow/Unfollow user\n\nYou will begin by analyzing the service\'s state and telemetry, and then submit your solution:\n1. str: "Yes" or "No" to indicate whether there are anomalies detected\n\nYou are provided with a direct API to a secure terminal to the service where you can run commands:\n\nexec_shell\nExecute any shell command in a predefined debugging environment.\n        Note: this is NOT A STATEFUL OR INTERACTIVE shell session. So you cannot\n        execute commands like "kubectl edit".\n\n        Args:\n            command (str): The command to execute.\n\n        Returns:\n            str: The output of the command.\n\nFinally, you will submit your solution for this task using the following API:\n\nsubmit\nSubmit if anomalies are detected to the orchestrator for evaluation.\n\n        Args:\n            has_anomaly (str): "Yes" if anomalies are detected, "No" otherwise.\n\n        Returns:\n            SubmissionStatus: The status of the submission.\n\nIMPORTANT:\n1.

So you cannot\n        execute commands like "kubectl edit".\n\n        Args:\n            command (str): The command to execute.\n\n        Returns:\n            str: The output of the command.\n\nFinally, you will submit your solution for this task using the following API:\n\nsubmit\nSubmit if anomalies are detected to the orchestrator for evaluation.\n\n        Args:\n            has_anomaly (str): "Yes" if anomalies are detected, "No" otherwise.\n\n        Returns:\n            SubmissionStatus: The status of the submission.\n\nIMPORTANT:\n1. The submit() call must strictly follow its defined parameter signature for this task.\n2.

[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are an expert DevOps engineer assigned to detect anomalies in a deployed service.\n\nService Details:\nService Name: Social Network\nNamespace: test-social-network\nDescription: A social network with unidirectional follow relationships, implemented with loosely-coupled microservices, communicating with each other via Thrift RPCs.\nSupported Operations:\n  - Create text post (optional media: image, video, shortened URL, user tag)\n  - Read post\n  - Read entire user timeline\n  - Receive recommendations on which users to follow\n  - Search database for user or post\n  - Register/Login using user credentials\n  - Follow/Unfollow user\n\nYou will begin by analyzing the service\'s state and telemetry, and then submit your solution:\n1. str: "Yes" or "No" to indicate whether there are anomalies detected\n\nYou are provided with a direct API to a secure terminal to the service where you can run commands:\n\nexec_shell\nExecute any shell command in a predefined debugging environment.\n        Note: this is NOT A STATEFUL OR INTERACTIVE shell session. So you cannot\n        execute commands like "kubectl edit".\n\n        Args:\n            command (str): The command to execute.\n\n        Returns:\n            str: The output of the command.\n\nFinally, you will submit your solution for this task using the following API:\n\nsubmit\nSubmit if anomalies are detected to the orchestrator for evaluation.\n\n        Args:\n            has_anomaly (str): "Yes" if anomalies are detected, "No" otherwise.\n\n        Returns:\n            SubmissionStatus: The status of the submission.\n\nIMPORTANT:\n1. The submit() call must strictly follow its defined parameter signature for this task.\n2.

[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are an expert DevOps engineer assigned to detect anomalies in a deployed service.\n\nService Details:\nService Name: Social Network\nNamespace: test-social-network\nDescription: A social network with unidirectional follow relationships, implemented with loosely-coupled microservices, communicating with each other via Thrift RPCs.\nSupported Operations:\n  - Create text post (optional media: image, video, shortened URL, user tag)\n  - Read post\n  - Read entire user timeline\n  - Receive recommendations on which users to follow\n  - Search database for user or post\n  - Register/Login using user credentials\n  - Follow/Unfollow user\n\nYou will begin by analyzing the service\'s state and telemetry, and then submit your solution:\n1. str: "Yes" or "No" to indicate whether there are anomalies detected\n\nYou are provided with a direct API to a secure terminal to the service where you can run commands:\n\nexec_shell\nExecute any shell command in a predefined debugging environment.\n        Note: this is NOT A STATEFUL OR INTERACTIVE shell session. So you cannot\n        execute commands like "kubectl edit".\n\n        Args:\n            command (str): The command to execute.\n\n        Returns:\n            str: The output of the command.\n\nFinally, you will submit your solution for this task using the following API:\n\nsubmit\nSubmit if anomalies are detected to the orchestrator for evaluation.\n\n        Args:\n            has_anomaly (str): "Yes" if anomalies are detected, "No" otherwise.\n\n        Returns:\n            SubmissionStatus: The status of the submission.\n\nIMPORTANT:\n1. The submit() call must strictly follow its defined parameter signature for this task.\n2.
