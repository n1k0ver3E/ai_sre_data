So you cannot\n        execute commands like "kubectl edit".\n\n        Args:\n            command (str): The command to execute.\n\n        Returns:\n            str: The output of the command.\n\nFinally, you will submit your solution for this task using the following API:\n\nsubmit\nSubmit once your mitigation solution is complete and ready to be evaluated.\n\n        Args:\n            None\n\n        Returns:\n            SubmissionStatus: The status of the submission.\n\nIMPORTANT:\n1.

So you cannot\n        execute commands like "kubectl edit".\n\n        Args:\n            command (str): The command to execute.\n\n        Returns:\n            str: The output of the command.\n\nFinally, you will submit your solution for this task using the following API:\n\nsubmit\nSubmit once your mitigation solution is complete and ready to be evaluated.\n\n        Args:\n            None\n\n        Returns:\n            SubmissionStatus: The status of the submission.\n\nIMPORTANT:\n1. The submit() call must strictly follow its defined parameter signature for this task.\n2. Provide the call in a markdown code block.\n\nAt each turn respond with:\nAction: <your action>\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '            You will respond with one of the above APIs as your next action.\n            Please respond in the following format in a markdown code block:\n            ```\n<API_NAME>(<API_PARAM1>, <API_PARAM2> ...)\n```\n\n            For instance, if you want to list files in current directory, your response must be exactly:\n\n            ```\nexec_shell("ls -l")\n```\n\n            Once your solution is complete and ready for evaluation, you must call:\n\n

So you cannot\n        execute commands like "kubectl edit".\n\n        Args:\n            command (str): The command to execute.\n\n        Returns:\n            str: The output of the command.\n\nFinally, you will submit your solution for this task using the following API:\n\nsubmit\nSubmit once your mitigation solution is complete and ready to be evaluated.\n\n        Args:\n            None\n\n        Returns:\n            SubmissionStatus: The status of the submission.\n\nIMPORTANT:\n1.

[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are an expert DevOps engineer assigned to mitigate anomalies in a deployed service.\n\nService Details:\nService Name: Social Network\nNamespace: test-social-network\nDescription: A social network with unidirectional follow relationships, implemented with loosely-coupled microservices, communicating with each other via Thrift RPCs.\nSupported Operations:\n  - Create text post (optional media: image, video, shortened URL, user tag)\n  - Read post\n  - Read entire user timeline\n  - Receive recommendations on which users to follow\n  - Search database for user or post\n  - Register/Login using user credentials\n  - Follow/Unfollow user\n\nYou will begin by analyzing the service\'s state and telemetry, and then submit a solution that mitigates any detected anomalies.\nYour mitigation can be performed using any of the available APIs.\n\nYou are provided with a direct API to a secure terminal to the service where you can run commands:\n\nexec_shell\nExecute any shell command in a predefined debugging environment.\n        Note: this is NOT A STATEFUL OR INTERACTIVE shell session. So you cannot\n        execute commands like "kubectl edit".\n\n        Args:\n            command (str): The command to execute.\n\n        Returns:\n            str: The output of the command.\n\nFinally, you will submit your solution for this task using the following API:\n\nsubmit\nSubmit once your mitigation solution is complete and ready to be evaluated.\n\n        Args:\n            None\n\n        Returns:\n            SubmissionStatus: The status of the submission.\n\nIMPORTANT:\n1. The submit() call must strictly follow its defined parameter signature for this task.\n2. Provide the call in a markdown code block.\n\nAt each turn respond with:\nAction: <your action>\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '            You will respond with one of the above APIs as your next action.\n            Please respond in the following format in a markdown code block:\n            ```\n<API_NAME>(<API_PARAM1>, <API_PARAM2> ...)\n```\n\n            For instance, if you want to list files in current directory, your response must be exactly:\n\n            ```\nexec_shell("ls -l")\n```\n\n            Once your solution is complete and ready for evaluation, you must call:\n\n            ```\nsubmit()\n```\n\n            Note:\n            - The submit() call for the mitigation task does not take any parameters.\n            - A submission via submit() is considered valid if it is made, though this does not necessarily indicate that your solution is correct.\n\n            Please respond with only a single API call (a.k.a., action) per turn without any additional words, labels, or prefixes.\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Please take the next action'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '```\nexec_shell("kubectl get pods -n test-social-network")\n```'}, {'role':

[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are an expert DevOps engineer assigned to mitigate anomalies in a deployed service.\n\nService Details:\nService Name: Social Network\nNamespace: test-social-network\nDescription: A social network with unidirectional follow relationships, implemented with loosely-coupled microservices, communicating with each other via Thrift RPCs.\nSupported Operations:\n  - Create text post (optional media: image, video, shortened URL, user tag)\n  - Read post\n  - Read entire user timeline\n  - Receive recommendations on which users to follow\n  - Search database for user or post\n  - Register/Login using user credentials\n  - Follow/Unfollow user\n\nYou will begin by analyzing the service\'s state and telemetry, and then submit a solution that mitigates any detected anomalies.\nYour mitigation can be performed using any of the available APIs.\n\nYou are provided with a direct API to a secure terminal to the service where you can run commands:\n\nexec_shell\nExecute any shell command in a predefined debugging environment.\n        Note: this is NOT A STATEFUL OR INTERACTIVE shell session. So you cannot\n        execute commands like "kubectl edit".\n\n        Args:\n            command (str): The command to execute.\n\n        Returns:\n            str: The output of the command.\n\nFinally, you will submit your solution for this task using the following API:\n\nsubmit\nSubmit once your mitigation solution is complete and ready to be evaluated.\n\n        Args:\n            None\n\n        Returns:\n            SubmissionStatus: The status of the submission.\n\nIMPORTANT:\n1. The submit() call must strictly follow its defined parameter signature for this task.\n2. Provide the call in a markdown code block.\n\nAt each turn respond with:\nAction: <your action>\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '            You will respond with one of the above APIs as your next action.\n            Please respond in the following format in a markdown code block:\n            ```\n<API_NAME>(<API_PARAM1>, <API_PARAM2> ...)\n```\n\n            For instance, if you want to list files in current directory, your response must be exactly:\n\n            ```\nexec_shell("ls -l")\n```\n\n            Once your solution is complete and ready for evaluation, you must call:\n\n

is made, though this does not necessarily indicate that your solution is correct.\n\n            Please respond with only a single API call (a.k.a., action) per turn without any additional words,

So you cannot\n        execute commands like "kubectl edit".\n\n        Args:\n            command (str): The command to execute.\n\n        Returns:\n            str: The output of the command.\n\nFinally, you will submit your solution for this task using the following API:\n\nsubmit\nSubmit once your mitigation solution is complete and ready to be evaluated.\n\n        Args:\n            None\n\n        Returns:\n            SubmissionStatus: The status of the submission.\n\nIMPORTANT:\n1.

So you cannot\n        execute commands like "kubectl edit".\n\n        Args:\n            command (str): The command to execute.\n\n        Returns:\n            str: The output of the command.\n\nFinally, you will submit your solution for this task using the following API:\n\nsubmit\nSubmit once your mitigation solution is complete and ready to be evaluated.\n\n        Args:\n            None\n\n        Returns:\n            SubmissionStatus: The status of the submission.\n\nIMPORTANT:\n1.

So you cannot\n        execute commands like "kubectl edit".\n\n        Args:\n            command (str): The command to execute.\n\n        Returns:\n            str: The output of the command.\n\nFinally, you will submit your solution for this task using the following API:\n\nsubmit\nSubmit once your mitigation solution is complete and ready to be evaluated.\n\n        Args:\n            None\n\n        Returns:\n            SubmissionStatus: The status of the submission.\n\nIMPORTANT:\n1.

So you cannot\n        execute commands like "kubectl edit".\n\n        Args:\n            command (str): The command to execute.\n\n        Returns:\n            str: The output of the command.\n\nFinally, you will submit your solution for this task using the following API:\n\nsubmit\nSubmit once your mitigation solution is complete and ready to be evaluated.\n\n        Args:\n            None\n\n        Returns:\n            SubmissionStatus: The status of the submission.\n\nIMPORTANT:\n1. The submit() call must strictly follow its defined parameter signature for this task.\n2. Provide the call in a markdown code block.\n\nAt each turn respond with:\nAction: <your action>\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '            You will respond with one of the above APIs as your next

files in current directory, your response must be exactly:\n\n            ```\nexec_shell("ls -l")\n```\n\n            Once your solution is complete and ready for evaluation, you must call:\n\n

So you cannot\n        execute commands like "kubectl edit".\n\n        Args:\n            command (str): The command to execute.\n\n        Returns:\n            str: The output of the command.\n\nFinally, you will submit your solution for this task using the following API:\n\nsubmit\nSubmit once your mitigation solution is complete and ready to be evaluated.\n\n        Args:\n            None\n\n        Returns:\n            SubmissionStatus: The status of the submission.\n\nIMPORTANT:\n1. The submit() call must strictly follow its defined parameter signature for this task.\n2. Provide the call in a markdown code block.\n\nAt each turn respond with:\nAction: <your action>\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '            You will respond with one of the above APIs as your next

files in current directory, your response must be exactly:\n\n            ```\nexec_shell("ls -l")\n```\n\n            Once your solution is complete and ready for evaluation, you must call:\n\n

is made, though this does not necessarily indicate that your solution is correct.\n\n            Please respond with only a single API call (a.k.a., action) per turn without any additional words,

[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are an expert DevOps engineer assigned to mitigate anomalies in a deployed service.\n\nService Details:\nService Name: Social Network\nNamespace: test-social-network\nDescription: A social network with unidirectional follow relationships, implemented with loosely-coupled microservices, communicating with each other via Thrift RPCs.\nSupported Operations:\n  - Create text post (optional media: image, video, shortened URL, user tag)\n  - Read post\n  - Read entire user timeline\n  - Receive recommendations on which users to follow\n  - Search database for user or post\n  - Register/Login using user credentials\n  - Follow/Unfollow user\n\nYou will begin by analyzing the service\'s state and telemetry, and then submit a solution that mitigates any detected anomalies.\nYour mitigation can be performed using any of the available APIs.\n\nYou are provided with a direct API to a secure terminal to the service where you can run commands:\n\nexec_shell\nExecute any shell command in a predefined debugging environment.\n        Note: this is NOT A STATEFUL OR INTERACTIVE shell session. So you cannot\n        execute commands like "kubectl edit".\n\n        Args:\n            command (str): The command to execute.\n\n        Returns:\n            str: The output of the command.\n\nFinally, you will submit your solution for this task using the following API:\n\nsubmit\nSubmit once your mitigation solution is complete and ready to be evaluated.\n\n        Args:\n            None\n\n        Returns:\n            SubmissionStatus: The status of the submission.\n\nIMPORTANT:\n1. The submit() call must strictly follow its defined parameter signature for this task.\n2. Provide the call in a markdown code block.\n\nAt each turn respond with:\nAction: <your action>\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '            You will respond with one of the above APIs as your next action.\n            Please respond in the following format in a markdown code block:\n            ```\n<API_NAME>(<API_PARAM1>, <API_PARAM2> ...)\n```\n\n            For instance, if you want to list files in current directory, your response must be exactly:\n\n            ```\nexec_shell("ls -l")\n```\n\n            Once your solution is complete and ready for evaluation, you must call:\n\n

is made, though this does not necessarily indicate that your solution is correct.\n\n            Please respond with only a single API call (a.k.a., action) per turn without any additional words,

So you cannot\n        execute commands like "kubectl edit".\n\n        Args:\n            command (str): The command to execute.\n\n        Returns:\n            str: The output of the command.\n\nFinally, you will submit your solution for this task using the following API:\n\nsubmit\nSubmit once your mitigation solution is complete and ready to be evaluated.\n\n        Args:\n            None\n\n        Returns:\n            SubmissionStatus: The status of the submission.\n\nIMPORTANT:\n1.

So you cannot\n        execute commands like "kubectl edit".\n\n        Args:\n            command (str): The command to execute.\n\n        Returns:\n            str: The output of the command.\n\nFinally, you will submit your solution for this task using the following API:\n\nsubmit\nSubmit once your mitigation solution is complete and ready to be evaluated.\n\n        Args:\n            None\n\n        Returns:\n            SubmissionStatus: The status of the submission.\n\nIMPORTANT:\n1. The submit() call must strictly follow its defined parameter signature for this task.\n2. Provide the call in a markdown code block.\n\nAt each turn respond with:\nAction: <your action>\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '            You will respond with one of the above APIs as your next action.\n            Please respond in the following format in a markdown code block:\n            ```\n<API_NAME>(<API_PARAM1>, <API_PARAM2> ...)\n```\n\n            For instance, if you want to list files in current directory, your response must be exactly:\n\n            ```\nexec_shell("ls -l")\n```\n\n            Once your solution is complete and ready for evaluation, you must call:\n\n

[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are an expert DevOps engineer assigned to mitigate anomalies in a deployed service.\n\nService Details:\nService Name: Social Network\nNamespace: test-social-network\nDescription: A social network with unidirectional follow relationships, implemented with loosely-coupled microservices, communicating with each other via Thrift RPCs.\nSupported Operations:\n  - Create text post (optional media: image, video, shortened URL, user tag)\n  - Read post\n  - Read entire user timeline\n  - Receive recommendations on which users to follow\n  - Search database for user or post\n  - Register/Login using user credentials\n  - Follow/Unfollow user\n\nYou will begin by analyzing the service\'s state and telemetry, and then submit a solution that mitigates any detected anomalies.\nYour mitigation can be performed using any of the available APIs.\n\nYou are provided with a direct API to a secure terminal to the service where you can run commands:\n\nexec_shell\nExecute any shell command in a predefined debugging environment.\n        Note: this is NOT A STATEFUL OR INTERACTIVE shell session. So you cannot\n        execute commands like "kubectl edit".\n\n        Args:\n            command (str): The command to execute.\n\n        Returns:\n            str: The output of the command.\n\nFinally, you will submit your solution for this task using the following API:\n\nsubmit\nSubmit once your mitigation solution is complete and ready to be evaluated.\n\n        Args:\n            None\n\n        Returns:\n            SubmissionStatus: The status of the submission.\n\nIMPORTANT:\n1. The submit() call must strictly follow its defined parameter signature for this task.\n2. Provide the call in a markdown code block.\n\nAt each turn respond with:\nAction: <your action>\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '            You will respond with one of the above APIs as your next action.\n            Please respond in the following format in a markdown code block:\n            ```\n<API_NAME>(<API_PARAM1>, <API_PARAM2> ...)\n```\n\n            For instance, if you want to list files in current directory, your response must be exactly:\n\n            ```\nexec_shell("ls -l")\n```\n\n            Once your solution is complete and ready for evaluation, you must call:\n\n

is made, though this does not necessarily indicate that your solution is correct.\n\n            Please respond with only a single API call (a.k.a., action) per turn without any additional words,

So you cannot\n        execute commands like "kubectl edit".\n\n        Args:\n            command (str): The command to execute.\n\n        Returns:\n            str: The output of the command.\n\nFinally, you will submit your solution for this task using the following API:\n\nsubmit\nSubmit once your mitigation solution is complete and ready to be evaluated.\n\n        Args:\n            None\n\n        Returns:\n            SubmissionStatus: The status of the submission.\n\nIMPORTANT:\n1. The submit() call must strictly follow its defined parameter signature for this task.\n2. Provide the call in a markdown code block.\n\nAt each turn respond with:\nAction: <your action>\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '            You will respond with one of the above APIs as your next action.\n            Please respond in the following format in a markdown code block:\n            ```\n<API_NAME>(<API_PARAM1>, <API_PARAM2> ...)\n```\n\n            For instance, if you want to list files in current directory, your response must be exactly:\n\n            ```\nexec_shell("ls -l")\n```\n\n            Once your solution is complete and ready for evaluation, you must call:\n\n            ```\nsubmit()\n```\n\n            Note:\n            - The submit() call for the mitigation task does not take any parameters.\n            - A submission via submit() is considered valid if it is made, though this does not necessarily indicate that your solution is correct.\n\n            Please respond with only a single API call (a.k.a., action) per turn without any additional words, labels, or prefixes.\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Please take the next action'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '```\nexec_shell("kubectl get pods -n test-social-network")\n```'}, {'role':

[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are an expert DevOps engineer assigned to mitigate anomalies in a deployed service.\n\nService Details:\nService Name: Social Network\nNamespace: test-social-network\nDescription: A social network with unidirectional follow relationships, implemented with loosely-coupled microservices, communicating with each other via Thrift RPCs.\nSupported Operations:\n  - Create text post (optional media: image, video, shortened URL, user tag)\n  - Read post\n  - Read entire user timeline\n  - Receive recommendations on which users to follow\n  - Search database for user or post\n  - Register/Login using user credentials\n  - Follow/Unfollow user\n\nYou will begin by analyzing the service\'s state and telemetry, and then submit a solution that mitigates any detected anomalies.\nYour mitigation can be performed using any of the available APIs.\n\nYou are provided with a direct API to a secure terminal to the service where you can run commands:\n\nexec_shell\nExecute any shell command in a predefined debugging environment.\n        Note: this is NOT A STATEFUL OR INTERACTIVE shell session. So you cannot\n        execute commands like "kubectl edit".\n\n        Args:\n            command (str): The command to execute.\n\n        Returns:\n            str: The output of the command.\n\nFinally, you will submit your solution for this task using the following API:\n\nsubmit\nSubmit once your mitigation solution is complete and ready to be evaluated.\n\n        Args:\n            None\n\n        Returns:\n            SubmissionStatus: The status of the submission.\n\nIMPORTANT:\n1.

[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are an expert DevOps engineer assigned to mitigate anomalies in a deployed service.\n\nService Details:\nService Name: Social Network\nNamespace: test-social-network\nDescription: A social network with unidirectional follow relationships, implemented with loosely-coupled microservices, communicating with each other via Thrift RPCs.\nSupported Operations:\n  - Create text post (optional media: image, video, shortened URL, user tag)\n  - Read post\n  - Read entire user timeline\n  - Receive recommendations on which users to follow\n  - Search database for user or post\n  - Register/Login using user credentials\n  - Follow/Unfollow user\n\nYou will begin by analyzing the service\'s state and telemetry, and then submit a solution that mitigates any detected anomalies.\nYour mitigation can be performed using any of the available APIs.\n\nYou are provided with a direct API to a secure terminal to the service where you can run commands:\n\nexec_shell\nExecute any shell command in a predefined debugging environment.\n        Note: this is NOT A STATEFUL OR INTERACTIVE shell session. So you cannot\n        execute commands like "kubectl edit".\n\n        Args:\n            command (str): The command to execute.\n\n        Returns:\n            str: The output of the command.\n\nFinally, you will submit your solution for this task using the following API:\n\nsubmit\nSubmit once your mitigation solution is complete and ready to be evaluated.\n\n        Args:\n            None\n\n        Returns:\n            SubmissionStatus: The status of the submission.\n\nIMPORTANT:\n1.

[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are an expert DevOps engineer assigned to mitigate anomalies in a deployed service.\n\nService Details:\nService Name: Social Network\nNamespace: test-social-network\nDescription: A social network with unidirectional follow relationships, implemented with loosely-coupled microservices, communicating with each other via Thrift RPCs.\nSupported Operations:\n  - Create text post (optional media: image, video, shortened URL, user tag)\n  - Read post\n  - Read entire user timeline\n  - Receive recommendations on which users to follow\n  - Search database for user or post\n  - Register/Login using user credentials\n  - Follow/Unfollow user\n\nYou will begin by analyzing the service\'s state and telemetry, and then submit a solution that mitigates any detected anomalies.\nYour mitigation can be performed using any of the available APIs.\n\nYou are provided with a direct API to a secure terminal to the service where you can run commands:\n\nexec_shell\nExecute any shell command in a predefined debugging environment.\n        Note: this is NOT A STATEFUL OR INTERACTIVE shell session. So you cannot\n        execute commands like "kubectl edit".\n\n        Args:\n            command (str): The command to execute.\n\n        Returns:\n            str: The output of the command.\n\nFinally, you will submit your solution for this task using the following API:\n\nsubmit\nSubmit once your mitigation solution is complete and ready to be evaluated.\n\n        Args:\n            None\n\n        Returns:\n            SubmissionStatus: The status of the submission.\n\nIMPORTANT:\n1. The submit() call must strictly follow its defined parameter signature for this task.\n2. Provide the call in a markdown code block.\n\nAt each turn respond with:\nAction: <your action>\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '            You will respond with one of the above APIs as your next

[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are an expert DevOps engineer assigned to mitigate anomalies in a deployed service.\n\nService Details:\nService Name: Social Network\nNamespace: test-social-network\nDescription: A social network with unidirectional follow relationships, implemented with loosely-coupled microservices, communicating with each other via Thrift RPCs.\nSupported Operations:\n  - Create text post (optional media: image, video, shortened URL, user tag)\n  - Read post\n  - Read entire user timeline\n  - Receive recommendations on which users to follow\n  - Search database for user or post\n  - Register/Login using user credentials\n  - Follow/Unfollow user\n\nYou will begin by analyzing the service\'s state and telemetry, and then submit a solution that mitigates any detected anomalies.\nYour mitigation can be performed using any of the available APIs.\n\nYou are provided with a direct API to a secure terminal to the service where you can run commands:\n\nexec_shell\nExecute any shell command in a predefined debugging environment.\n        Note: this is NOT A STATEFUL OR INTERACTIVE shell session. So you cannot\n        execute commands like "kubectl edit".\n\n        Args:\n            command (str): The command to execute.\n\n        Returns:\n            str: The output of the command.\n\nFinally, you will submit your solution for this task using the following API:\n\nsubmit\nSubmit once your mitigation solution is complete and ready to be evaluated.\n\n        Args:\n            None\n\n        Returns:\n            SubmissionStatus: The status of the submission.\n\nIMPORTANT:\n1.

[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are an expert DevOps engineer assigned to mitigate anomalies in a deployed service.\n\nService Details:\nService Name: Social Network\nNamespace: test-social-network\nDescription: A social network with unidirectional follow relationships, implemented with loosely-coupled microservices, communicating with each other via Thrift RPCs.\nSupported Operations:\n  - Create text post (optional media: image, video, shortened URL, user tag)\n  - Read post\n  - Read entire user timeline\n  - Receive recommendations on which users to follow\n  - Search database for user or post\n  - Register/Login using user credentials\n  - Follow/Unfollow user\n\nYou will begin by analyzing the service\'s state and telemetry, and then submit a solution that mitigates any detected anomalies.\nYour mitigation can be performed using any of the available APIs.\n\nYou are provided with a direct API to a secure terminal to the service where you can run commands:\n\nexec_shell\nExecute any shell command in a predefined debugging environment.\n        Note: this is NOT A STATEFUL OR INTERACTIVE shell session. So you cannot\n        execute commands like "kubectl edit".\n\n        Args:\n            command (str): The command to execute.\n\n        Returns:\n            str: The output of the command.\n\nFinally, you will submit your solution for this task using the following API:\n\nsubmit\nSubmit once your mitigation solution is complete and ready to be evaluated.\n\n        Args:\n            None\n\n        Returns:\n            SubmissionStatus: The status of the submission.\n\nIMPORTANT:\n1. The submit() call must strictly follow its defined parameter signature for this task.\n2. Provide the call in a markdown code block.\n\nAt each turn respond with:\nAction: <your action>\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '            You will respond with one of the above APIs as your next action.\n            Please respond in the following format in a markdown code block:\n            ```\n<API_NAME>(<API_PARAM1>, <API_PARAM2> ...)\n```\n\n            For instance, if you want to list files in current directory, your response must be exactly:\n\n            ```\nexec_shell("ls -l")\n```\n\n            Once your solution is complete and ready for evaluation, you must call:\n\n

is made, though this does not necessarily indicate that your solution is correct.\n\n            Please respond with only a single API call (a.k.a., action) per turn without any additional words,

[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are an expert DevOps engineer assigned to mitigate anomalies in a deployed service.\n\nService Details:\nService Name: Social Network\nNamespace: test-social-network\nDescription: A social network with unidirectional follow relationships, implemented with loosely-coupled microservices, communicating with each other via Thrift RPCs.\nSupported Operations:\n  - Create text post (optional media: image, video, shortened URL, user tag)\n  - Read post\n  - Read entire user timeline\n  - Receive recommendations on which users to follow\n  - Search database for user or post\n  - Register/Login using user credentials\n  - Follow/Unfollow user\n\nYou will begin by analyzing the service\'s state and telemetry, and then submit a solution that mitigates any detected anomalies.\nYour mitigation can be performed using any of the available APIs.\n\nYou are provided with a direct API to a secure terminal to the service where you can run commands:\n\nexec_shell\nExecute any shell command in a predefined debugging environment.\n        Note: this is NOT A STATEFUL OR INTERACTIVE shell session. So you cannot\n        execute commands like "kubectl edit".\n\n        Args:\n            command (str): The command to execute.\n\n        Returns:\n            str: The output of the command.\n\nFinally, you will submit your solution for this task using the following API:\n\nsubmit\nSubmit once your mitigation solution is complete and ready to be evaluated.\n\n        Args:\n            None\n\n        Returns:\n            SubmissionStatus: The status of the submission.\n\nIMPORTANT:\n1.

Provide the call in a markdown code block.\n\nAt each turn respond with:\nAction: <your action>\n'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '            You will respond with one of the above APIs as your next

files in current directory, your response must be exactly:\n\n            ```\nexec_shell("ls -l")\n```\n\n            Once your solution is complete and ready for evaluation, you must call:\n\n
